The challenge which I am attempting to solve is the inherent risks involved in day trading, along with lowering the amount of time the user needs to spend to make any sort of worthwhile project. To do this I am going to write a program which will decide on and make trades without any input from the user, apart from signals to stop and start trading. It will also have to present current trades to the user. These programs are called algotraders.
Algorithmic trading programs are used to automatically analyse an asset and related data, e.g. historical open and close prices, sentiment or social media scores, market volume and historical data on related indexes and assets, and then make a trade based on the signals produced from this analysis. They rely on market inefficiencies to predict where the asset will go and to make a correct trade before other traders do. 
The advantage they have over manual trading, is that they can operate for the entirety of market open, or continuously for assets such as cryptocurrency, and they can make trades based on much more data than a human trader. They will not act based on impulse, which can be a significant cause of losses for a manual trader. The algorithms used are varied, but are usually involving arbitrage or are quantitative in nature.
Examples of this sort of program are commonly found in use by hedge funds, with funds such as Renaissance Technologiesâ€™ Medallion fund and D.E.Shaw being notable examples.
