This piece of software will analyse a singular asset class, and trade based on signals generated from the analysis. It will do this in order to minimise human involvement in trading, and to allow hidden patterns to be utilised to make profit.
By using software exclusively for the whole process, rather than introducing a human element, the human liability caused by emotion and instinctive reaction is lowered, and more complex analysis can be performed in a fraction of the time it would take for a human to do so. The idea behind algorithmic traders is to find market patterns which can be exploited for profit, mainly through quantitative analysis (using mathematical and statistical methods to determine the value of an asset) often incorporating various forms of machine learning. The signals that this analysis produces can then be fed into a strategy (using predefined rules to make trades based on previous analysis), which will dictate what trades should be made. Quantitative analysis and automated trading is used by many funds, such as Renaissance Technologies, AQR, and D.E.Shaw, as well as by smaller independent traders. These methods can be used successfully in a variety of markets, such as stocks, options and securities.
